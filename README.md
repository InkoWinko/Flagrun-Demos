# Flagrun-Demos
Flagrun Demos with timings off when the demos were taken. Along side with the map thumbnails in HD. Simply do /demo (demo direction), then then /seekdemo (time in the demo name, instead off the . use :). For example /seekdemo -8:30. This will leave you to the time when the record was about to run.
